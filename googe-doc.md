# Task: Building Backend for Google Docs-Like Application

## Project Overview:
You are tasked with developing the backend services for a Google Docs-like collaborative document editing application. The application should allow multiple users to create, edit, share, and collaborate on documents in real-time.

## Features:
1. **User Authentication**:
   - Implement user authentication with email/password or OAuth.
   - Users should be able to sign up, log in, and log out.
   - Include basic user profile functionality (name, email, profile picture).

2. **Document CRUD Operations**:
   - Authenticated users can create new documents.
   - Users can view a list of their documents.
   - Implement functionality to edit documents in real-time. (Just setting status is enough)
   - Users can delete their own documents.

3. **Document Sharing and Collaboration**:
   - Users can share documents with other users by email.
   - Collaborators can edit the document simultaneously in real-time. (Just showing editing status is enough)
   - Implement a presence system to show who is currently editing a document.
   - Include a comment system for users to leave comments on specific parts of the document.

4. **Version History**:
   - Implement version control for documents.
   - Users can view and restore previous versions of a document.

5. **Document Permissions**:
   - Users can set permissions for documents (view, edit, comment) when sharing.
   - Owners can revoke access to shared documents.

6. **Search**:
   - Include a search functionality to search for documents by title or content.

## Additional Notes:
- The focus of this task is on functionality and backend API development.
- Use any libraries, frameworks, or packages that you find suitable for the task.
- Document your code and provide a brief README with instructions on how to run the backend services locally.
- Optionally, provide a brief overview of the project structure, design decisions, and any challenges faced during development.

## Deliverables:
- Submit the source code of the backend services along with necessary setup instructions.
- Include a README.md file explaining how to set up the development environment, install dependencies, and run the backend services.
- Optionally, provide insights into project structure, design decisions, and any challenges faced during development.
Certainly! Here are the updated technical requirements for building the backend of a Google Docs-like application, categorized according to the specified topics:


## Technical Requirements:

### 1. OS:
- Develop and test the application to run on any operating systems for both development and production environments. Using Docker is encouraged.

### 2. Networking:
- Ensure the application can handle HTTP/HTTPS requests.
- Implement secure communication using SSL/TLS.
- Handle network timeouts gracefully.

### 3. Version Control:
- Use Git as the version control system.
- Maintain a Git repository for the project.
- Follow Git best practices for branching, merging, and commit messages.

### 4. DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms):
- Utilize appropriate data structures and algorithms for efficient document retrieval, search, and collaboration.

### 5. Programming Language:
- Use Golang for backend development.

### 6. Databases:
- Design database structures in a diagram.
- Use any suitable database for storing user data, documents, document versions, comments, etc.
- Utilize database indexes for efficient querying.
- Ensure proper database migrations for schema changes.

### 7. File Storage:
- Store document attachments (images, videos) in an object storage system like Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage.
- Implement logic for secure file upload and retrieval.

### 8. Message Broker:
- Implement a message broker system (e.g., RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka) for asynchronous tasks such as notifications and real-time collaboration updates.

### 9. Documentation:
- Maintain detailed documentation using Markdown or reStructuredText.
- Document API endpoints, data models, installation instructions, and development guidelines.
- Include README.md with setup instructions, usage examples, and project overview.

### 10. Architecture:
- Implement a scalable and maintainable architecture.
- Design clean separation of concerns and modules for easy maintenance.
- Choose an architecture pattern (e.g., MVC, Microservices) that fits the application's requirements.

### 11. System Design:
- Design scalable and fault-tolerant systems for handling document collaboration and real-time updates.
- Consider load balancing, caching, and database sharding for performance.
- Plan for horizontal scalability with multiple instances of the application.

### 12. Design Patterns:
- Implement design patterns such as Singleton, Factory, Observer, etc., as appropriate for the application's needs.

### 13. DevOps:
- Use Docker for containerization of the application.
- Implement CI/CD pipelines with tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.
- Automate deployment processes for staging and production environments.

### 14. Cloud and Infrastructure:
- Deploy the application on cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.
- Utilize infrastructure as code (IaC) tools like Terraform or AWS CloudFormation for managing cloud resources.
- Set up virtual private clouds (VPCs), security groups, and network ACLs for security.

### 15. API Design:
- Design clear and consistent RESTful API endpoints for document operations (create, read, update, delete).
- Use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for CRUD operations.
- Implement token-based authentication (JWT tokens) for API security.

### 16. Testing:
- Write unit tests for backend services.
- Implement integration tests for testing interactions between components.
- Use tools like Postman or Swagger for API testing and documentation.

### 17. SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle):
- Follow an agile development methodology with regular sprints.
- Use project management tools like Jira or Trello for task tracking and collaboration.
- Implement proper code reviews and continuous improvement practices.

### 18. Mapping:
- Implement geolocation features for documents (optional).
- Use mapping libraries like Leaflet or Google Maps for displaying document locations.

### 19. Caching:
- Utilize caching mechanisms like Redis or Memcached for caching frequently accessed document data.
- Implement cache invalidation strategies to keep data consistent.

### 20. Data Pipeline:
- Design a data pipeline for processing and analyzing document data (e.g., version history, document changes).
- Use tools like Apache Spark or Kafka Streams for real-time data processing.

### 21. Performance:
- Optimize database queries with indexes and query optimization techniques.
- Use CDN (Content Delivery Network) for serving static assets to improve load times.
- Implement load testing to ensure the backend can handle a large number of concurrent document edits and searches.

### 22. Security:
- Implement secure password hashing (bcrypt) for user authentication.
- Sanitize user inputs to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.
- Use HTTPS for secure communication.
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for document permissions.

### 23. Cost Optimization:
- Optimize cloud infrastructure costs by right-sizing instances and storage.
- Use auto-scaling to adjust resources based on demand.
- Monitor and analyze cloud costs regularly to identify areas for optimization.
